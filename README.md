    * During the countdown, quickly place your cursor in the main code section of the Codetantra window.

## ‚ú® Bonus Tips

* **Active Window Extension:** Use the browser extension named **ACTIVE WINDOW** on Codetantra. It can help prevent the test timer from starting while you are setting up.
* **Stay in Place:** To avoid issues, **do not switch tabs** for AI help. Instead, open a new browser window (like a separate instance of Chrome) to consult AI for coding assistance.
